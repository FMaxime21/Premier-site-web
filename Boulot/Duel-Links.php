             <p class="Noir"> This is a mobile card game appeared in 2016 in 
                  Japan and 2017 in Europe.It allows to play online with all the
                  mythical characters of YU-GI-OH such as Yugi, Kaiba or Joey.
                  I started the game in 2017 and if I had to say one thing:
                  do not try to play for the first time today at the game.<br>
                  The advantage that we have online in the game depends on the hours of play.
                  This game is what we can call a "pay to win". If you do not put a little
                  money in this game, it is almost impossible to compete with other duelists.<br>
                  There is a system with normal, super rare and ultra rare cards. If you do
                  not have a lot of SR and UR in your decks, you will stay at the bottom of 
                  the rankings.<br> Speaking of rankings, it is often very difficult for 
                  players to become the king of games, especially as far as I am concerned.<br>
                  Even if there is a lot to say about this game, it is still great because
                  it allows us to dive back into nostalgy with the emblematic cards of the 
                  series, to compete against players from around the world and also to be 
                  able to think of strategies as in a puzzle game.<br> This game allowed to
                  play with friends who are more or less distant from us. This is the opinion
                  of a big fan of YU-GI-OH but not the best. If I had to advise you a good 
                  card game, virtual or irl, it would be that one. Of course I do not advise 
                  you to buy the real cards of the game, it is not obligatory.<br> You can enjoy 
                  the game in different ways or even in one way. Mine is the video game and 
                  that's enough for me.
